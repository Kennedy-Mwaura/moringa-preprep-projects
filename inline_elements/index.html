            Lamu is a place like no other, a peaceful tropical island where
            life is lived at it’s own relaxed rhythm, but a place whose
            history is as mysterious and fascinating as the winding streets
            of it’s medieval stone town.

            Getting to Turkana overland is no mean feat. While it is
            possible to fly to the Lake in a Chartered aircraft, it must be
            said that flying to Turkana some what distills the adventure.
