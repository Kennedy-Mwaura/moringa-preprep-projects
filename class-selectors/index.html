        <h2>Featuring Kijabe</h2>
        <p class="summary">
            Pine trees belong to a family of trees called <strong>conifer</strong>.

        <h2>Geographical Distribution</h2>
        <p class="article description" id="pine">
            Most regions of the Northern hemisphere host some native species of pines. <a class="note" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pine">More info</a>. This doesn't mean that pine trees do not grow in the southern hemisphere.<br>
            Take <em>Kijabe</em> for example.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Kijabe</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Kijabe is in the Sounthern Hemisphere, but has a diverse population of pine trees.
        </p>
        <div class="questions"><h4>Is this weird?</h4></div>
        <p class="article short-note">Not exactly.</p>
        <p class="article description">
            Weird explanation: Geographically speaking, the earth rotates on a tilted axis, which means that for almost half of the day, Kijabe is in the Northern Hemisphere (at least if we consider the cosmic plane).
        </p>
        <p class="center">
            Really, though, we started by saying that <a href="#pine">most pine trees grow on the Northern Hemisphere</a>. But does not mean that no pine trees grow in the southern hemisphere.
