        Acording to Wikipedis, Udacity is "Udacity a for-profit educational 
        organisation founded by Sebastian Thrun, David Stavens, and Mike Sokolsky 
        offering masssive open online courses (MOOCS) "
    </p>
    <p>
        put simply, udacity is an online learning platform offering free or 
        cheap access to quality education in computer science. It is a resource 
        that I encourage anyone interested in software technology to check out. 
        If you SPOC, Udacity is for you.
